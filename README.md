# ðŸ”‹ EV Adoption Forecasting

Forecasting electric vehicle (EV) adoption to support infrastructure planning and sustainability initiatives.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

As electric vehicle (EV) adoption accelerates, cities and states must anticipate infrastructure needsâ€”especially charging stations. This project builds a forecasting model to predict EV adoption in Washington State using historical vehicle registration data from 2017 to 2024.

Using time series and machine learning models, the project provides forecasts of EV growth to assist urban planners, policy makers, and utility providers in long-term infrastructure development.
